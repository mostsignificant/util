Installation
============

Start by cloning or downloading the project from github_. Within the coml 
library folder, you will find different directories with the actual sources, 
data sets and examples, additional tools, documentation, and the tests for the 
coml library.

Since the coml library is a header-only library, you can also simply copy and 
paste the coml folder from the include directory into your own project and put 
the path into your project's include paths.
